# AWS Polly TTS Setup

This document explains how to set up AWS Polly for high-quality text-to-speech in the game.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Get AWS Credentials
1. Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
2. Create an IAM user with Polly permissions
3. Generate access keys

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

### 3. Test the Setup
Check if it's working:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tts
```

Should return `"configured": true` when AWS credentials are set.
